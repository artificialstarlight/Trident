# Trident
Ternary computer emulator written in Python

# Usage
Have Python 3.x installed, as well as Pygame. This is meant to work on Windows computers.
Navigate to the folder where you put ternary-comp.py
Run "python ternary-comp.py FILENAME.tri" from cmd
Make sure ternary-comp.py and logic_and_base_conversion.py are in the same folder

# Documentation
See "opcodes.txt" for documentation on the machine instruction Trident uses.

Any file you give Trident which contains machine code must have the code all on one line, no spaces.

# Assembler

Is a WIP. It is meant to convert instructions into valid Trident machine code. Hasn't been updated, do not reccommend using as of now.
