# Trident
Ternary computer emulator written in Python

# Usage

Run .\ternary-comp.exe FILENAME.tri
Or drag the filename.tri over the .exe. Optional argument DEBUG for..debugging .tri programs.
Like this: .\ternary-comp.exe FILENAME.tri DEBUG

# Documentation
See "opcodes.txt" for documentation on the machine instruction Trident uses.

Any file you give Trident which contains machine code must have the code all on one line, no spaces.

The included .tri files are tests. draw-test.tri should draw a block sprite. a2.tri should draw a weird looking, small, squareish sprite.
keyboard-test.tri ends the program when a key is pressed.

# Assembler

Is a WIP. It is meant to convert instructions into valid Trident machine code. Hasn't been updated, do not reccommend using as of now.

# Windows Defender says this is a virus!

The source code is *right there*. It is not a virus, you can look through it if you want.
